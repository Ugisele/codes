    Before you leap into the cleaning business, it's important to look at it with<br> 
    20/20 vision. Though technology has certainly had an impact on cleaning services, <br>
    this is not a high-tech business. Nor is there any glitz to it. And there will be times<br> 
    when you'll have as much trouble as Rodney Dangerfield getting respect. <br>  
    But the upside is that you can build an extremely profitable business that will <br> 
    generate revenue very quickly. Most cleaning service businesses can be operated on either <br> 
    a part-time or full-time basis, either from home or from a That flexibility gives this industry<br>  
    a strong appeal to a wide range of people with a variety of goals.<br><br>
